To get started, follow [[https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-editor-services#setting-up-editor-services-for-development][the directions found here]] to install
=puppet-editor-services=. Set =lsp-puppet-server-install-dir= to the
cloned repository and set =lsp-puppet-modulepath= accordingly.

*NOTE*: I had to apply a tiny patch to =puppet-languageserver-sidecar= to
 avoid a bug that prevented LSP from functioning properly. See below:
